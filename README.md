## Architecture

RustMon now consists of three main components:

## Run and build

Install dependencies:

`npm i`

Run local dev mode:

`ng serve`

Build redist package:

`ng build --prod`

or if you don't have angular installed

`npm run buildprod`

## Environment Variables

The backend service now supports additional environment variables for Pterodactyl integration. See `user-data-srv/src/environment.ts` for the complete list.

# run with docker in server:

## Dashboard:

```
docker run -p 80:80 -itd alexander171294/rustmon:latest
```

Or see live instance in:

[rustmon.tercerpiso.net](https://rustmon.tercerpiso.net)

## Backend Service:

Api for get steam-profile, api-geolocalization, rustmap info:

First, in order to use your custom served api, you need to edit environment.prod.ts and change `http://rustmon-udata.tercerpiso.tech/` for your endpoint and rebuild docker image, or run ng build again with your changes.

Second, you need to start a redis service (it is used for cache user data).

Third, you need to run our docker image of rustmon-service with your api key and environments and expose in your endpoint:

```
docker run -p 80:3000 -e STEAM_API="YOUR-STEAM-API-KEY" -e CACHE_HOST="YOUR-REDIS-HOST" -e CACHE_AUTH="YOUR-REDIS-PASSWORD" -e CACHE_PORT="YOUR-REDIS-PORT" -itd alexander171294/rustmon-service:latest
```
